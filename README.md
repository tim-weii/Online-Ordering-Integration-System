#  Online Ordering & Integration System

##  Project Background
During Taiwan‚Äôs labor shortage in the service industry, many restaurants faced severe staffing challenges, creating high demand for **self-service ordering and payment systems**.  
However, most commercial solutions at the time adopted a **high-cost leasing model** (tens of thousands of NT dollars annually), while systems were isolated and **unable to integrate operations across multiple restaurants**.  

These ‚Äúflashy but impractical‚Äù systems increased expenses without truly reducing labor or operational pressure.

##  Project Overview
This project was developed with **PHP, MySQL, MongoDB, and JavaScript**, integrated with **Google Maps API, Taiwan Pay, and ENIVTurnkey (Taiwan Ministry of Finance e-Invoice Transmission Software)**.  
The goal was to create a **cost-effective and integrated online ordering system** that reduces reliance on manpower while providing a unified management platform for multiple restaurants.  

The system includes **User Module, Vendor Module, and Backend Management Module**, supporting multi-store operations and real-time data flow.  


#### EINVTurnkey
EINVTurnkey is the **official e-Invoice transmission software provided by Taiwan‚Äôs Ministry of Finance (MOF)**.  
It ensures secure and standardized electronic invoice submission, making the system compliant with Taiwan‚Äôs taxation and e-invoice regulations.

##  System Modules

### 1. Login & Registration
- **JavaScript-based switching** between **User Mode** and **Vendor Mode**.  
- **Separate MySQL tables** for users and vendors.  
- Supports account registration, login, and permission management.

### 2. Ordering Homepage
- **Google Maps API integration**: Displays store distance from the user‚Äôs location.  
- **One-click navigation**: Directly redirects to Google Maps for route planning.

### 3. Store Product Page
- One of the most complex parts, with **1,000+ lines of code**.  
- **Multi-layer options**: e.g., drinks require choices for sugar, ice, and size, with all possible combinations supported.  
- **Relational database design**: Ensures product, options, pricing, and inventory remain consistent and flexible.

### 4. Checkout & Payment
- **Order modes**: Dine-in, takeaway, or reservation (with time setting).  
- **Payment**: Integrated with **Taiwan Pay** for secure transfers.

</p>
---

### 5. Store Management (Vendor Side)
- **Multi-store management**: A single vendor can register and manage multiple branches.  
- **Unified Business Number validation**: Vendors must provide company ID to comply with regulations.

</p>

### 6. Backend Order System
- **Real-time notifications**: Implemented with **Ajax** to instantly push orders to vendors.  
- **Future plan**: Replace Ajax with **WebSocket** for improved real-time performance.

</p>
---

### 7. Backend Revenue System
- **Revenue analysis**: Tracks completed orders and displays revenue and item counts by date/time.  
- **Data visualization**: Provides graphical reports for quick insights.
